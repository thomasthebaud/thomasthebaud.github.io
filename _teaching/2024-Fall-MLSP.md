I was co-instructor for the  Machine Learning for Signal Processing Course for grad and undergrad students of the ECE department in the Fall 2024. This course included 3 teaching periods per week to 50 students, for a total of 3 credits for the attendees.

This course focused on the use of machine learning theory and algorithms to model, classify and retrieve information from different kinds of real world complex signals such as audio, speech, image and video. The coding was in python, and the course was evaluated by grouped project carried by the students across the semester.
