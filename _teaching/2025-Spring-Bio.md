I will be Instructor and Founder of the Biometric Systems: Techniques, Applications, and Ethics for grad and undergrad students of the ECE department in the Fall 2024. This course will include 3 teaching periods per week to 50 students, for a total of 3 credits for the attendees.

The proposed course, Biometric Systems: Techniques, Applications, and Ethics, will offer an in-depth exploration of both traditional and biometric authentication techniques, with an emphasis on their use in commercial and forensic applications. 
Designed for undergraduate and graduate students, this course will cover behavioral and physiological biometric systems while tackling these technologies' complex legal, ethical, and moral considerations.
