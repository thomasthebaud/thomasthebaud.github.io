I supervised Quentin DEME during a master intership of 6 months at the end of his engineering master.
Quentin worked on membership inference attacks on speaker recognition networks, showing you can guess which speaker was part of the training dataset if you have access to the softmax outputs, but not from the associated x-vectors.
