I was Instructor for the Explore Machine Learning solutions for Security Course for undergrad students of the School of Engineering. 
This course included one period of teaching per week, to two separate groups of 10 students, for a total of 1 credit for the attendees.

This course offered a practical and hands-on introduction to machine learning algorithms using Python. Through real-life examples, students learnt how to implement various machine-learning techniques used in my previous researchs, for authentication and attack detection. The course was designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of machine learning concepts, accompanied by practical coding exercises and a guided collaborative group project.
It was part of the HEART program, an initiative to allow Post-doctoral fellows and PhD students to create their own courses and teach alone in from of small groups of students.
