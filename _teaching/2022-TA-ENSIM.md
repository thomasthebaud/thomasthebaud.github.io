I was a Teaching Assistant for the course on Machine Learning in the 'Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Ingenieurs du Mans".
We taught students about basic Machine learning techniques, data preparation and Deep Learning basics, through Python.
I had the responsibility of 2 groups of 10-15 students for one lab per week.
