I was co-instructor for the Computational Modelling for Electrical and Computer Engineering Course for undergrad students of the ECE department. This course included 3 teaching periods per week to 50 students, for a total of 3 credits for the attendees.

In this course, the students acquired the skills of solving complex real world Electrical and Computer Engineering problems using computational modeling tools. This course coverted two aspects ofsolving those ECE problems. The first aspect consisted of learning to map ECE tasks to mathematical models. The second aspect consisted of introducingthe students to the basic of computational algorithms needed to work with the models, and programming such algorithms in MATLAB.
