Abstract:
As the prevalence of voice-controlled devices and speech systems continues to grow, so too does the importance of ensuring their security and reliability. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial and poisoning attacks, which can exploit vulnerabilities and compromise their performance. In this talk, we delve into the intricate landscape of adversarial attacks targeting speech systems, presenting our research on detecting and classifying these attacks to better understand their nuances and impact. Furthermore, we discuss the creation of dirty and clean label poisoning attacks, where maliciously crafted data is injected into training datasets, and explore their implications on system integrity. We also examine a range of defenses designed to mitigate the effects of poisoning attacks, aiming to increase the resilience of speech recognition systems against such threats.
