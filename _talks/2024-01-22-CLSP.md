I gave short seminar of 30min about the bases of attacks against speech system.
The abstract was ""The majority of today's machine learning algorithms share common foundations and core concepts, rendering them susceptible to various attacks. In this short talk, I would like to dive into the world of adversarial attacks and poisoning attacks on speech systems. What are they, how dangerous are they, and what can be done against them?"
This talk was targetting PhD student and grad students.
