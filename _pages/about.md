I am currently finishing my Post-doctoral fellowship, and will hold the position of Assistant Research Scientist at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University starting in November. I completed my Ph.D. in Antispoofing for Voice and Handwriting Biometrics, a collaborative effort between LIUM in Le Mans, France, and Orange Labs in Rennes, France. I am now based in Baltimore, Maryland, where I am engaged in a range of exciting projects related to speech and handwriting.

My research encompasses various areas, including the utilization of handwriting signals for the assessment of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, I focus on developing novel threat models and defenses to counteract poisoning attacks against Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, adversarial attacks targeting speaker recognition systems, and advancements in speech translation systems and emotion recognition.

Furthermore, I am actively involved as a board member of the post-doctoral association, where I contribute to the organization of social and professional events for the benefit of all post-doctoral fellows at the Homewood campus.
