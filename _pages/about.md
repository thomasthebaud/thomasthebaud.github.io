I am currently Assistant Research Scientist at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University. I completed my Ph.D. in Antispoofing for Voice and Handwriting Biometrics, a collaborative effort between LIUM in Le Mans, France, and Orange Labs in Rennes, France. I am now based in Baltimore, Maryland, where I am engaged in a range of exciting projects related to speech and handwriting.

My research encompasses various areas, including the utilization of handwriting signals for the assessment of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, I focus on developing novel threat models and defenses to counteract poisoning attacks against Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, and adversarial attacks targeting speaker recognition systems. Recently I have been taking interest in speech translation systems, conversation summarization and emotion recognition systems.

Furthermore, I am involved as a board member of the post-doctoral association, where I contribute to the organization of social and professional events for the benefit of all post-doctoral fellows at the Homewood campus.
